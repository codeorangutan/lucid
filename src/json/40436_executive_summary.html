        <div>This screening assessment integrated cognitive performance testing (reporting only on valid results) and self-reported symptom questionnaires for Patient ID <strong>40436</strong>.<br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptom Screening:</strong> symptom screening was consistent with an Combined Presentation profile, meeting criteria for 9/9 inattention and 6/9 hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Profile:</strong> overall <em>valid</em> cognitive performance (NCI) was in the average range, with strengths in psychomotor speed, working memory, sustained attention, motor speed, reaction time* and relative weaknesses in simple attention noted in valid domains.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Reported Symptoms (NPQ):</strong> the NPQ did not indicate significant concerns rated Moderate or Severe in the surveyed domains. Potential moderate excessive daytime sleepiness was also noted.</li>
