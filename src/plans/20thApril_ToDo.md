Major Suggestions & Issues:

Incomplete Core Pipeline: The biggest issue is that several critical stages defined in the Orchestration Plan.md and ProjectPlan.md are only stubs or placeholders in orchestrator.py. Logic needs to be implemented for:
1) process_new_reports: Detecting and downloading completed reports (Phase 5).
2) reformat_and_save_reports: Processing/reformatting downloaded reports (Phase 6 - noted as needing integration).
3) send_reports_to_referrers: Emailing the final report (Phase 7).
4) send_reminders: Sending reminders for incomplete tests (Phase 8).
5) enforce_safety_limits: Fully implementing checks beyond basic logging warnings (Phase 9/Orchestration Plan).

Orchestration Flow Control: The email_receiver.py currently handles fetching and saving new referrals directly to the database (save_referral). The process_new_referrals function in orchestrator.py only lists emails but doesn't process or save them. For better separation of concerns and adherence to the orchestration model, email_receiver.py should ideally focus on fetching/parsing, returning the data to orchestrator.py, which then handles validation, DB interaction, and status updates for that stage.

Report Reformatter Integration: Phase 6 (Report Reformatter) is explicitly mentioned as needing integration. This logic needs to be built or adapted and called within the reformat_and_save_reports function in the orchestrator.

Configuration Management: While request_cns_test.py correctly uses config.ini for credentials, other parts of the system might benefit from this (e.g., email addresses, reminder intervals, API scopes if they change). Centralizing configuration improves maintainability (ETC principle).
Parsing Brittleness: email_receiver.py uses regular expressions (parse_email_body) to extract data. This can be prone to errors if the format of incoming emails varies even slightly. Consider making this more robust, perhaps using more flexible parsing or encouraging structured data in referral emails if possible.

Security Implementation: The plan mentions DB encryption (pysqlcipher3) and log scrubbing (Phase 9), but these are not yet implemented. Given the handling of potential PHI, these should be prioritized.

Testing Framework: The plans and user rules emphasize testing (TDD), but there's no evidence of a testing framework (tests/ directory, test files) being used yet. Implementing unit and integration tests is crucial for verifying each stage and the overall workflow.
