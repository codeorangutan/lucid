# **Improvements to Report Structure**

1. **Layout and White Space:**  
   * **Consistent Grid & Margins:** Implement a consistent grid system and maintain uniform margins and padding throughout all pages. This creates a more organized and less cluttered look.  
   * **Increase White Space:** Use white space more effectively around elements like tables (Modules 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11), charts (Modules 3, 7), and text blocks to improve readability and reduce visual density.  
   * **Visual Hierarchy:** Strengthen the visual hierarchy. Use size, weight, and spacing to clearly distinguish between main headings (like "Cognitive Domain Scores"), sub-headings (like test names in Module 6), and body text/data.  
2. **Typography:**  
   * **Modern Font:** Replace default or older fonts with a clean, modern sans-serif font (like Inter, Lato, Montserrat) for better screen readability and a contemporary feel.  
   * **Typographic Scale:** Define a clear typographic scale for different text elements (titles, headers, sub-headers, body text, labels) and apply it consistently.  
   * **Line Spacing & Length:** Optimize line spacing (leading) and line length for comfortable reading, especially in text-heavy sections like the NPQ responses (Module 10).  
3. **Color and Branding:**  
   * **Defined Palette:** Establish a refined color palette. Use the "Lucid" brand colors consistently (e.g., in headers/footers \- Module 1\) but complement them with a set of neutral tones for backgrounds/text and potentially 1-2 accent colors for calls-to-action or highlighting key data points.  
   * **Purposeful Color Use:** Apply color meaningfully. Use distinct colors for the classifications (Module 3 legend, Module 5 table) and severity levels (Module 9 legend, Module 10 table), ensuring high contrast for accessibility. Avoid using too many competing colors.  
   * **Subtle Backgrounds:** Consider using very light grey or off-white backgrounds for sections or tables to create subtle separation without overwhelming the content.  
4. **Data Visualization:**  
   * **Radar Chart (Module 3):** Simplify the visual elements. Use cleaner lines, perhaps less intense background fills, and ensure labels are clearly legible and don't overlap awkwardly. Consider highlighting the patient's score line more prominently.  
   * **Scatter Plots (Module 7):** Improve clarity. Ensure axes are clearly labeled, use a more visually appealing marker for the patient's data point, and make the legend less intrusive but still clear. Consider interactive tooltips if designing for digital display.  
   * **Consistency:** Ensure all charts use the same fonts, color palette, and general styling.  
5. **Tables (Modules 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11):**  
   * **Readability:** Improve table readability using techniques like alternating row colors (zebra striping), clear but minimal borders (perhaps just horizontal lines), and appropriate cell padding.  
   * **Alignment:** Ensure consistent text and numerical alignment within columns.  
   * **Emphasis:** Use font weight or subtle color to highlight key data points or classifications within the tables.  
6. **Iconography:**  
   * **Subtle Icons:** Consider using simple, modern icons sparingly to supplement information â€“ for example, small icons next to the "Classification" column (Module 4\) or "Severity" column (Modules 9, 10), or next to section titles. Ensure icons are consistent in style.  
7. **Overall Consistency:**  
   * Apply all design choices (fonts, colors, spacing, component styles) consistently across every module and page to create a cohesive and professional look and feel. The Header/Footer module (Module 1\) plays a key role here.

By applying these principles, the report can become more scannable, easier to interpret, and visually engaging, enhancing the user experience for clinicians or patients reviewing the information.
