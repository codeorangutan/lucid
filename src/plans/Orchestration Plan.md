entralized Polling Script: Detailed Plan
1. High-Level Structure
One script (e.g., orchestrator.py) is run every 10 minutes (by cron, Task Scheduler, or manually).
Each pipeline stage is a function that:
Checks the database for items in a specific state.
Processes them as needed.
Updates the database to reflect progress.
Logging and error handling are consistent and robust.
2. Pipeline Stages & Functions
A. Intake: Process New Referrals
Goal: Detect new referral emails, parse, and save to DB.
Steps:
Fetch unread referral emails (reuse logic from email_receiver.py).
Parse for patient info.
If not already in DB, create a new patient/referral record.
Mark email as read.
Optionally, send acknowledgment to referrer.
Log actions.
B. Test Request: Initiate CNS Test
Goal: For new referrals, trigger Playwright automation to request a test.
Steps:
Query DB for patients with status “waiting_for_test”.
For each, run Playwright to request test.
Update DB: set status to “test_requested”, log timestamp.
Log actions and errors.
C. Report Monitoring: Detect Test Completion
Goal: Monitor for report notification emails.
Steps:
Fetch unread report notification emails.
Parse for patient ID, download report.
Update DB: set status to “report_downloaded”.
Mark email as read.
Log actions.
D. Report Processing: Reformat and Save
Goal: Reformat the downloaded report and save to DB.
Steps:
Query DB for patients with status “report_downloaded”.
Run reformatter (existing or new function).
Save reformatted report to DB.
Update status to “report_reformatted”.
Log actions.
E. Report Delivery: Email to Referrer
Goal: Email reformatted report to referrer.
Steps:
Query DB for “report_reformatted” status.
Send email with attachment.
Update status to “report_sent”.
Log timestamp and actions.
F. Reminders: Nagging for Incomplete Tests
Goal: Send reminders if test not completed within time window.
Steps:
Query DB for “test_requested” status with timestamps > X days old.
Send reminder email to patient.
Log reminder sent (and how many times).
Optionally, expire test after max reminders.
G. Safety & Limits
Goal: Prevent abuse or accidental flooding.
Steps:
Check for multiple requests for the same patient in a day.
Enforce per-day and per-patient limits.
Log and skip excess requests.

4. Best Practices
Idempotency: Each function should be safe to run multiple times (e.g., don’t double-send emails).
Logging: Use a consistent logger across all functions.
Error Handling: Catch and log exceptions, but don’t let one failure stop the whole pipeline.
Testing: Write unit tests for each function, and integration tests for the main flow.
Configuration: Store credentials, timing, and limits in a config file (e.g., config.ini).
5. Incremental Migration
Start by wrapping your existing scripts as functions.
Integrate them into the orchestrator.
Test each stage independently before running the full pipeline.
Gradually add more stages and safety checks.
6. Scheduling
Use cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run python orchestrator.py every 10 minutes.

Update your Mermaid flow diagram to reflect this polling orchestration.
