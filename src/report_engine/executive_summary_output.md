## Symptom Screening Results (ASRS/DSM-5 Alignment)

Based on self-reported symptoms (ASRS/DSM-5 alignment), the screening suggests a presentation consistent with **Combined Presentation**.

* Endorsed symptoms met criteria for **9/9 Inattention** domains.
* Endorsed symptoms met criteria for **6/9 Hyperactivity/Impulsivity** domains.

## Cognitive Performance

The overall **Neurocognition Index (NCI)** was in the **`[Average]`** range (Standard Score: `[106.0]`, Percentile: `[66.0]`).

### Cognitive Strengths (Valid Domains):
* Psychomotor Speed (Percentile: 95.0, Range: Superior)
* Working Memory (Percentile: 92.0, Range: Superior)
* Sustained Attention (Percentile: 90.0, Range: High Average)
* Motor Speed (Percentile: 82.0, Range: High Average)
* Reaction Time* (Percentile: 79.0, Range: High Average)

### Cognitive Weaknesses (Valid Domains):
* Simple Attention (Percentile: 6.0, Range: Borderline Impaired)

### Specific Subtest Observations (Valid Subtests):
* Continuous Performance Test (CPT) - Commission Errors* (Percentile: 2.0, Range: Borderline Impaired)
* Stroop Test (ST) - Stroop Commission Errors* (Percentile: 3.0, Range: Borderline Impaired)
* Visual Memory Test (VSM) - Correct Passes - Delay (Percentile: 6.0, Range: Borderline Impaired)
* Visual Memory Test (VSM) - Correct Hits - Immediate (Percentile: 95.0, Range: Superior)
* Four Part Continuous Performance Test - Correct Responses (Percentile: 95.0, Range: Superior)
* Four Part Continuous Performance Test - Omission Errors* (Percentile: 95.0, Range: Superior)
* Symbol Digit Coding (SDC) - Correct Responses (Percentile: 96.0, Range: Superior)

## Summary & Integration

This screening assessment integrated cognitive performance testing (reporting only on valid results) and self-reported symptom questionnaires for Patient ID `[40436]`.

* **Symptom Screening:** symptom screening was consistent with an **Combined Presentation** profile, meeting criteria for 9/9 inattention and 6/9 hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms.
* **Cognitive Profile:** overall *valid* cognitive performance (NCI) was in the average range, with strengths in psychomotor speed, working memory, sustained attention, motor speed, reaction time* and relative weaknesses in simple attention noted in valid domains.
* **Self-Reported Symptoms (NPQ):** the NPQ did not indicate significant concerns rated Moderate or Severe in the surveyed domains. Potential moderate excessive daytime sleepiness was also noted.

## Recommendations

Based on the screening results, further clinical evaluation is recommended. This evaluation should confirm the potential ADHD presentation and evaluate potential sleep-related issues. The information gathered here provides a baseline and highlights areas for more in-depth assessment by a qualified healthcare professional.
