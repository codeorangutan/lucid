The template now includes:

A new section titled "Cognitive Domain Profile" placed after "Demographics".
A <canvas id="cognitiveRadarChart"> element within this new section.
An updated populateReport function that:
Defines the order of domains for the radar chart (radarDomainsOrder).
Extracts labels and percentile data from reportData.cognitive_scores based on the defined order.
Calls a new function createRadarChart to render the chart using Chart.js.
The createRadarChart function handles the Chart.js configuration, styling (using colors that complement the Tailwind theme), and rendering. It also destroys any previous chart instance if populateReport is called multiple times.
Remember to assign your JSON data to the window.reportData variable and call populateReport() after the data is loaded to render the report with the chart.
